**Outline Zoning Plan (OZP)** is a statutory plan that prepared and published by the Town Planning Board under the provisions of the Town Planning Ordinance in Hong Kong. It shows the land use zones, development restrictions and major road systems of an individual planning area. Areas covered by OZPs are in general zoned for uses such as residential, commercial, industrial, green belt, open space, government, institution or community uses, or other specified uses.

**Development Scheme Plan (DSP)** is a statutory planning document that sets out the broad land use and development proposals for a designated area. It is prepared by the Planning Department and approved by the Chief Executive in Council under the Town Planning Ordinance.
